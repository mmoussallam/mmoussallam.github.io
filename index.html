<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div class="alert">This site is work in progress, if you don't find what you look for: please check the <a

I am currently working as head of R&D at <a href="www.deezer.com">Deezer</a>. This page however presents the research I did prior to that.

<h2>Research Area</h2>
<h3>Sparse signal decompositions</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<div class="subParagContent">
    <p>I have been (and still am) very interested in sparse decomposition algorithms, especially greedy ones
        and essentially on Audio/Acoustics signals (e.g. 1D data) <br>During my PhD I have developped a variant
        of the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm, which is called Random Sequential Subdictionaries Matching Pursuit
        (RSSMP). It mainly uses randomness to artificially increase the number of atoms among which the algorithm is
        allowed to choose.<br>
        I then used this algorithm to enhance low bitrate audio compression schemes.

<h3>Audio Source Separation</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<div class="paragContent">
    Source Separation is the process of retrieving mixed signals given only their mixtures. This typically the case of
    musical signals
    where multiple instruments play simultaneously and only the mix is available.
    Recently a lot of interest in repetition-based method encouraged me to propose separation algorithm that exploits
    the knowledge of
    repeating musical patterns. Combined with a classical sparse prior on the source, a structured sparsity model can be
    derived.
    The problem becomes an instance of a Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) case and can be addressed using a greedy
    algorithm.

<h3>Blind Denoising of time series</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<div class="paragContent">
    Denoising with sparse approximation is a fairly mature field since the wavelet thresholding era.
    Most state-of-the-art techniques, however, require the knowledge of the noise characteristics
    and/or statistical properties, which might not be available in practice. Instead, we can assume that the
    informative part of the signal is sparse in some known basis, on which the additive noise is incoherent.
    When a greedy algorithm is used for denoising, these assumptions provide a self-stopping criterion,
    without knowledge of the noise level. Combined with a randomization of the dictionary at each iteration,
    this forms the basis of a new denoising procedure, called Blind Random Pursuit Denoising (BIRD). It can
    be generalized to the denoising of multidimensional signals, with a structured sparse model (S-BIRD).
    The relevance of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental M/EEG signals, where
    BIRD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, even with an oracle knowledge of the noise level.

<h3>Reproducing research and code</h3>
<div class="paragContent">
    <p>A Python package for greedy decomposition (including RSSMP)
        is available in the form of the PyMP package (on <a href="https://github.com/mmoussallam/PyMP">github</a>).
        I try to provide extensive <a href="http://moussallam.net/manu/PyMP/">documentation</a> and even wrote tutorials
        to reproduce some results from the paper. </p>
    <p> Source code for our denoising algorithm BIRD is on <a href="https://github.com/mmoussallam/bird">github</a> (Joint work with A.
        Gramfort) </p>
    <p>If you're interested in getting code from my other work please feel free to contact me.</p>
